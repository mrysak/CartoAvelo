A dashboard to monitor the impact of cycling policies in French local authorities, at all administrative levels (communes, EPCI, départements, regions, France as a whole). 
The aim is to provide local authorities with a tool enabling them to measure their performance on several themes, and to compare themselves with local authorities sharing a similar context.
