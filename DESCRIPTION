Description: A dashboard to monitor the impact of cycling policies in
    French local authorities, at all administrative levels (communes,
    EPCI, départements, regions, France as a whole). The aim is to provide
    local authorities with a tool enabling them to measure their
    performance on several themes, and to compare themselves with local
    authorities sharing a similar context.
